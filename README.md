# isideload

[![Build isideload](https://github.com/nab138/isideload/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nab138/isideload/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A Rust library for sideloading iOS applications using an Apple ID. Used in [CrossCode](https://github.com/nab138/CrossCode) and [iloader](https://github.com/nab138/iloader).

This branch is home to isideload-next, the next major version of isideload. It features a redesigned API, improved error handling, better entitlement handling, and more. It is not ready!

## Usage

**You must call `isideload::init()` at the start of your program to ensure that errors are properly reported.** If you don't, errors related to network requests will not show any details.

A full usage example is available is in [examples/minimal](examples/minimal/).

## TODO

Things left todo before the rewrite is considered finished

- Proper entitlement handling
  - actually parse macho files and stuff, right now it just uses the bare minimum and applies extra entitlements for livecontainer
- Reduce duplicate dependencies
  - partially just need to wait for the rust crypto ecosystem to get through another release cycle
- More parallelism and caching for better performance
